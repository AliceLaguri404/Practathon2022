We have followed a brute force approach to check distances between the query vector and the randomly generated vectors and to store the nearest ten points we have used max heap as a data structure.
For saving time we have not calculated distances to compare but instead we are comparing sum of absolute differences between the coordinates of the randomly generated vectors and the query vector.
